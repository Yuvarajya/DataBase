*This image shows a snapshot of the PostgreSQL database used in the Customer Information Dashboard. It displays the structure and a sample of the data stored in the `customer` table, which includes fields such as serial number (`sno`), customer name (`customer_name`), age, phone, location, and the timestamp of record creation (`created_at`). This database is integral to the functioning of the dashboard, enabling data manipulation and retrieval operations that power the application.*
